     -> An Object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined a template(info)
        is defined. Memory is allotted only after object instantiation.

        -> Hiding internal details (Show only essential info)
       2. Encapsulation
        -> The act of putting various components together (in a capsule)
           In java encapsulation simply means that the sensitive data can be
           hidden from the user.
       3. Inheritance
        -> The act of deriving new things from existing things
       4. Polymorphism
